# Unit Converter(Length)

## Sprint 1:

  Join KSU-IS github team
  
  Find prior README.md and project  roadmap documents to use as an example
  
  Create my own README.md
  
  Creat Project Road Map file
  
  Find and clone an example repository: https://github.com/ksu-is/Currency-Converter

  Understood how I could use tKinter with grid method and decided to base on the Currency Converter code to build my app
