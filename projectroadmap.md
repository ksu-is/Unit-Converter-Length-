# Unit Converter(Length)

## Sprint 1:

  Join KSU-IS github team
  
  Find prior README.md and project roadmap documents to use as an example
  
  Create my own README.md
  
  Creat Project Road Map file
  
  Find and clone an example repository: https://github.com/ksu-is/Currency-Converter and  https://github.com/ksu-is/CalcGUI-2.0.git

  Understood how I could use tKinter with grid method and decided to base on the Currency     Converter code and CalcGUI to build my app
  
  Build a function that converts ['miles','yard','feet','inches'] to ['km','m','cm','mm']
