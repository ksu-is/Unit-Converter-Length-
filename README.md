# Unit-Converter-Length-
Project Name: Unit Converter(Length)

Introduction: For my project ideas assignment, I found a Currency-Converter on GitHub. That app showed me that if I enter the amount of USD, it automatically changed to other currency for me. As a person who came from South Korea, one of the challenges for me is realizing a length of unit. Not only South Korea but also many countries are using “km”, “m”, “cm”, and “mm”. However, the United States is using “miles”, “yard”, “feet”, and “inches”. In the Unit (Length) Converter, I can put any number and by clicking the button, it will automatically convert the unit of length.

Target Users: The main target user for this app is people who came from the countries that are using “km”, “m”, “cm”, and “mm” to indicate the length. It is hard for those people to realize the “miles”, “yard”, “feet”, and “inches” and understand how long or short it is. When you enter the number, it will convert “miles”, “yard”, “feet”, and “inches” to “km”, “m”, “cm”, and “mm”. Also, people who are using “miles”, “yard”, “feet”, and “inches” can use this app well. For example, when Americans travel to other countries, they might have a hard time understanding the unit of length.

Function: Users will have to enter a number that they want to convert. There will be two blanks to put numbers and 8 options for each blank to select unit of length. For example, if they want to change the unit of length (inch to centimeter), they will have to put the number that would like to change in the first blank and select the unit of length. Then you select the unit of length that would like to see in the second blank. The result will be automatically displayed in the second blank. Please see attached image for design.
